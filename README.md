## **Data Structures and Algorithms.**

This repository contains over 200 data structures and algorithm questions and their solution for interview preparation from different websites and Cracking the Coding Interview book by  Laakmann Gayle McDowell


Hash Table - in simple terms we can say that a hasktable is a key value look up, It is a data structure that maps a key to a value for high efficient look up. 

**Function to display hashtable** 

```python
# Function to display hashtable
def display_hash(hashTable):
      
    for i in range(len(hashTable)):
        print(i, end = " ")
          
        for j in hashTable[i]:
            print("-->", end = " ")
            print(j, end = " ")
              
        print()
  
# Creating Hashtable as 
# a nested list.
HashTable = [[] for _ in range(10)]
  
# Hashing Function to return 
# key for every value.
def Hashing(keyvalue):
    return keyvalue % len(HashTable)
  
  
# Insert Function to add
# values to the hash table
def insert(Hashtable, keyvalue, value):
      
    hash_key = Hashing(keyvalue)
    Hashtable[hash_key].append(value)
  
# Driver Code
insert(HashTable, 10, 'Harun')
insert(HashTable, 25, 'Mwenda')
insert(HashTable, 20, 'Linet')
insert(HashTable, 9, 'Patrick')
insert(HashTable, 21, 'Mwendwa')
insert(HashTable, 21, 'Mwangi')
  
display_hash (HashTable)
```


**Check duplicate.**

```python 
def get_squared_number(numbers):
    squared_numbers = [] 
    for n in numbers: 
        squared_numbers.append(n*n) 
    return squared_numbers 

numbers = [10,20,30]

get_squared_number(numbers)
```

### **Day 1**

1). Question 1: Implement an algorithm using Python to determine if all characters in a string are unique, What if you can not use additional data structures. 

```python 
MAX_CHAR = 256;
 
def uniqueCharacters(string):
    n = len(string)
     
    # If length is greater than 256,
    # some characters must have
    # been repeated
    if n > MAX_CHAR:
        return False
 
    chars = [False] * MAX_CHAR
 
    for i in range(n):
        index = ord(string[i])
 
        '''
         * If the value is already True,
         string has duplicate characters,
         return False'''
        if (chars[index] == True):
            return False
 
        chars[index] = True
 
    ''' No duplicates encountered,
        return True '''
    return True
 
# Driver code
if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = input("Enter your Text: ")
    if (uniqueCharacters(input)):
        print(f"The String {input} has all unique characters")

    else:
        print("The String {input} has duplicate characters")
 

``` 


**Note:** The time complexity is 0(n) while space complexity is 0(1)

2). Question 2: Given two strings write a method to decide if one os a permutation or the other. 


```python 
def arePermutation(str1, str2):
     
    # Get lengths of both strings
    n1 = len(str1)
    n2 = len(str2)
 
    # If length of both strings is not same,
    # then they cannot be Permutation
    if (n1 != n2):
        return False
 
    # Sort both strings
    a = sorted(str1)
    str1 = " ".join(a)
    b = sorted(str2)
    str2 = " ".join(b)
 
    # Compare sorted strings
    for i in range(0, n1, 1):
        if (str1[i] != str2[i]):
            return False
 
    return True
 
# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    str1 = "test"
    str2 = "ttew"
    if (arePermutation(str1, str2)):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```

3). Question 3: Write an algorithm such that if an element in a MxN matrix is O, it entire row and column is set to 0. 


--- 
4). Question 4: Implement an algorithm to find the 4th to the last element of a singly linked list. 


--- 

5). Question 5: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

### **Day 2**

---
1). Question 1: Write a program that finds the length of the last word.  

**Solution : Python3** 

```python 
def length_of_last_word(s):
        words = s.split()
        if len(words) == 0:
            return 0
        return len(words[-1])

print(length_of_last_word("Python Exercises"))
print(length_of_last_word("Python"))
print(length_of_last_word(""))
print(length_of_last_word("  "))

#Output: 
#9
#6
#0
#0

```

2). Question 2: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome( example of a palindrome is madam). 

--- 

3). Question 3:  Given a linked list which might contain a loop, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop (if one doesnâ€™t exist)  

---


4). Question 4: Explain how you could use a single array to implement three stacks. 


---

5). Question 5: Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
